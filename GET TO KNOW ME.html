 Hello! I am Rodilyn Martirez Tale, currently studying in Las Piñas City National  Science High School from 9-Fidelity. I am 14 years old, born on June 23, 2010, and the youngest in my family. I have a caring Mother, hardworking Father, supportive Oldest Sister, and understanding Older Sister. In school, I have closest friends - Irca, Raina, Angel, Nathan, and Raven. They've been my friends since Grade 8. Currently, I enjoy sports, dancing, watching movies, playing board games, listening to music, and more. Grade 9 has brought unexpected events, but I'm grateful for each blessing.
