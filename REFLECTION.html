<h2 align="center"> <b> REFLECTION 1ST QUARTER </b> </h2>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"> In this First Quarter, I have learned a lot of things and some of them have good results while some really have to be practiced to make it better. During this short period of time, I also met new friends-Jolynne, Elyze, Cairis, Inigo, Gab, and many more. However, I also had a hard time during ICT time because I am really not good at subjects like this and that's why I sometimes got envious by some that is good at ICT. But, I am very excited for the next chapter and I hope that it will be as much exciting like this Quarter. </p>
<h2 align="center"> <b> REFLECTION 2ND QUARTER </b> </h2>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"> During this Second Quarter, we did not have a lot of PTs and discussion because of some projects during contest. We are really grateful to Miss Uminga for letting us borrow her time to do the certain tasks. However, I have also learned a lot since Miss U gave us a lot of time to practice coding at home which helped me especially I need a lot of time in coding since I am not the best but I can slowly tell that I am getting better. I hope that for the next Quarters our class can still have fun and I am very excited for the upcoming challenges. </p>
